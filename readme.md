## KneeDetection

Detects knees in a profile

### Description

Explains how to use the second derivative of a profile to find knees

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the profiles after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
